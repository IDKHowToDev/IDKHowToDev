## Hello there stranger 👋

I'm an **AI major** who loves diving into anything that sparks my curiosity —  
machine learning, data science, MLOps, VR experiments, weird side-projects, you name it.

I enjoy building things that actually work, breaking things that shouldn’t break,  
and avoiding JavaScript at all costs (it's personal).

### 🌱 What I’m into
- Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning  
- Data Engineering / MLOps pipelines  
- App & Web development (the parts that involve typesript or very little javascript 😄)  
- Small experiments that turn into big projects  

### 🔭 What I'm looking for
Anything fun, challenging, or just interesting enough to make me forget to sleep.

### 💬 Feel free to reach out
If you want to collaborate, talk tech, or throw a random idea at me — I'm always listening.
